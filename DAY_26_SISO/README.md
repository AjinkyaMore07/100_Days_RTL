A Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) shift register is a sequential logic circuit designed to shift data into and out of the register one bit at a time in a serial fashion. Here's a detailed explanation and an example implementation in Verilog:
Detailed Explanation

    Basic Operation:
        In a SISO shift register, data is loaded into the register one bit at a time (serially) and shifted out in the same manner. Each clock pulse shifts the data one position to the right, with the serial input entering the leftmost flip-flop and the rightmost flip-flop's data appearing at the serial output.

    Components:
        The shift register consists of a series of flip-flops (commonly D flip-flops) connected in a chain. The output of one flip-flop is connected to the input of the next flip-flop in the sequence.

    Clock Synchronization:
        All flip-flops in the register operate synchronously, meaning they share the same clock signal. This ensures that all data shifts occur simultaneously with each clock pulse.

    Applications:
   1] The SISO shift register is mainly used to generate time delays in digital logic circuits.
   2] These shift registers are used to transfer manipulation and store the data.
   3] SISO register is used efficiently to decrease the no. of wires connecting the different systems within the design.
   4] SISO shift register delays data through a single CLK time for every stage & they will store a data bit for every register.
   5] These types of registers are mainly used especially for time delays.
