Priority Encoders
A priority encoder is a type of encoder that includes the capability to prioritize the input lines. In a situation where multiple inputs are active simultaneously, the priority encoder will encode the highest-priority active input. Here are the types of priority encoders:

    Simple Priority Encoder:
        It encodes the highest-priority active input among several active inputs.
        Typically, the input with the highest binary value gets the highest priority.
        Commonly used in systems where a simple hierarchy of priority is required.

    Binary Priority Encoder:
        Similar to a simple priority encoder, but the outputs are in binary form.
        Widely used in digital circuits to compress multiple binary inputs into a smaller number of outputs.

    Decimal-to-BCD Priority Encoder:
        Converts decimal input to Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) output.
        Useful in applications involving numerical data processing and display.

    4-to-2, 8-to-3, 16-to-4 Priority Encoders:
        These refer to the number of input lines and the corresponding number of output lines.
        A 4-to-2 priority encoder has 4 inputs and 2 outputs, an 8-to-3 has 8 inputs and 3 outputs, and a 16-to-4 has 16 inputs and 4 outputs.

    Cascading Priority Encoder:
        Multiple priority encoders can be cascaded to handle a larger number of inputs.
        For example, three 4-to-2 encoders can be cascaded to handle 12 inputs, providing a more scalable solution for complex systems.

Applications of Priority Encoders

Priority encoders are used in various applications, including:

    Interrupt Controllers: To determine the highest-priority interrupt request in microprocessors and microcontrollers.
    Data Compression: To encode multiple inputs into fewer output bits.
    Resource Allocation: To manage access to shared resources in computer systems.
    Communication Systems: To prioritize and encode data signals.
