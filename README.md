# 100 Days of RTL Code: Digital Circuits ðŸš€

Welcome to the 100 Days of RTL Code for Digital Circuits repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repository is dedicated to helping engineers, students, and enthusiasts build a strong foundation in digital circuit design using RTL (Register Transfer Level) coding. Each day features a new digital circuit or concept, explained and implemented using Verilog/SystemVerilog.

ðŸ“œ What is this Repository About?

This repository is a 100-day challenge aimed at exploring and mastering digital design concepts through hands-on coding. You will learn how to design, implement, and verify various combinational and sequential circuits, as well as gain exposure to industry-relevant best practices.

âœ¨ Key Features
---
    1. Daily RTL Code: Each day includes a specific digital circuit   with explanations.
    2. Progressive Learning: From basic combinational circuits to advanced sequential designs.
    3. Industry-Ready: Examples follow RTL coding conventions used in professional settings.
    4. Testbenches: Every module is accompanied by a testbench for functional verification.
    5. Open Source: Completely free to use, learn, and contribute to!.


ðŸ”§ Tools and Requirements
---
    Hardware Description Language: Verilog/SystemVerilog
    Simulator: ModelSim, XSIM, or any Verilog simulator
    Waveform Viewer: GTKWave or a simulator-integrated viewer
    Optional: Open-source tools like Yosys and Icarus Verilog


  ðŸŽ¯ Goals
---
    By the end of 100 days, you will:

    Understand the RTL design flow.
    Be comfortable designing and verifying digital circuits.
    Have a personal portfolio of 100 RTL projects!
