# Module Overview

  Inputs:
        in: The signal for which edges need to be detected.
        clk: The clock signal to synchronize the edge detection process.
        reset: A signal to reset the module's state.

  Output:
        out: A signal that goes high for one clock cycle when a rising edge on in is detected.

  Internal Register:
        temp: Holds the previous value of in for comparison.


  This Verilog module implements an edge detector to detect rising edges of an input signal (in). Let me break it down step by step:
Module Overview

  Inputs:
        in: The signal for which edges need to be detected.
        clk: The clock signal to synchronize the edge detection process.
        reset: A signal to reset the module's state.

   Output:
        out: A signal that goes high for one clock cycle when a rising edge on in is detected.

   Internal Register:
        temp: Holds the previous value of in for comparison.

Functionality

The functionality revolves around detecting a transition from 0 to 1 (rising edge) in the input signal in.

    Synchronous Reset:
        When reset is high:
            temp is reset to 0 to clear the stored state of the input.
            out is reset to 0 to ensure no false edge detection.

    Edge Detection Logic:
        The previous value of in is stored in temp.
        The current value of in is compared with temp to detect an edge:
            A rising edge occurs when:
            out=∼temp&in
            out=∼temp&in
                ~temp ensures the previous value of in was 0.
                in ensures the current value of in is 1.

    Behavior:
        If a rising edge is detected, out goes high for one clock cycle.
